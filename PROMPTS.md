# PROMPTS (Prompt Engineering Log)

**Goal:** Build a resume-ready Python project comparing Air vs Ocean freight for international shipments using real BTS ocean data and air chargeable weight calculations.

## Initial Request
"I want a Python project for my supply chain resume. Something technical that shows calculations and analytics of freight."

## Iteration 1 - Project Direction
"I like option 2 (chargeable weight + mode mix optimizer). Make it:
1. Use real data that can be sourced
2. Analytics-heavy (pandas + stats + dashboard)
3. Focus on chargeable weight + mode decisions (Air vs Ocean)"

## Iteration 2 - International Focus
"Focus on international moves (Air vs Ocean) using the BTS ocean container dataset heavily."

## Iteration 3 - Repository Structure
"Can you give me the exact copy and code text for:
- requirements.txt
- .gitignore
- PROMPTS.md
- README.md"

## Final Implementation
Created a complete Python analytics project with:
- BTS ocean spot-rate data integration
- Air chargeable weight calculations (volumetric vs actual)
- Mode recommendation engine based on cost and SLA
- Analytics features (packaging sensitivity, break-even analysis)
- Complete documentation and reproducible setup
